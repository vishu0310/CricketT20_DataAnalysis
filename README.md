## Overview
Welcome to the CricketT20_DataAnalysis repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing T20 cricket match data to uncover insights and trends in the game. Whether you are a cricket enthusiast, a data analyst, or someone interested in sports analytics, this repository offers a comprehensive look into the world of T20 cricket through data.

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and key features of T20 cricket data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform various statistical analyses to identify trends and patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Create insightful visualizations to present findings in an engaging manner.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop predictive models to forecast match outcomes and player performance.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build interactive dashboards to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), containing comprehensive information on T20 matches, player statistics, team performance, and match outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Scripts and notebooks for cleaning and preprocessing raw data to make it analysis-ready.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing various EDA techniques to understand the data better.
- **Visualizations**: A collection of visualizations created using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Predictive Models**: Implementation of machine learning models to predict match outcomes and player performance.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Dashboards built with tools like Tableau or Plotly Dash for dynamic data exploration.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) (for Tableau dashboards)
- [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) (for Plotly Dash dashboards)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CricketT20_DataAnalysis.git
   cd CricketT20_DataAnalysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. **Explore Notebooks**: Start with the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to get a sense of the data and analyses.
   - Open Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook.

2. **Run Scripts**: Use the scripts in the `scripts` directory to replicate the analysis and visualizations.
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_cleaning.py
   python scripts/eda.py
   python scripts/visualizations.py
   python scripts/modeling.py
   ```

3. **View Dashboards**: Open the interactive dashboards in the `dashboards` directory for dynamic data exploration.
   - For Tableau dashboards, open the `.twbx` files using Tableau Desktop.
   - For Plotly Dash apps, run the app files:
     ```bash
     python dashboards/plotly_dash/app.py
     ```
